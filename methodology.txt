We want to see how many times the student can match all 11 envelopes to the person who wrote them.

We will assign the first person to envelope 0, the second person to envelope 1, the third person to envelope 2, and so on, until the eleventh person wrote envelope 10.

The program will choose at random a sequence of 11 numbers from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], which represents all the envelopes. 

If the the generator gave back the same sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it would entail each envelope being matched back to their owners.

If the generator chose the sequence [0, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 10], it would entail all students being given the correct envelope, except for the second and 10th students, whose envelopes were switched.

In a perfect match, each value is the same as its index in the list. So, we can check for a student being handed the right envelope by checking the if the value is the same as its index.
